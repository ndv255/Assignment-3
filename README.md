# Assignment-3

This is my use of flocking I made a brand new game although I did grab a few assets and scripts from my previously uploaded game. For the base I used a file uploaded for notes for flocking I modified it to better work in my game. Everything that was not reused in this game either has a C# script or no script. This game it is "a" to move left "d" to move right and "space" to jump. The goal is to stay alive for 20 seconds while hornets flock around the hive that moves around the navigation area the hive keeps moving and the hornets have a speed that does not decelerate so that they will never just stop next to the hive to force them to weave through the map. This is something I could Add to my main game as an obstacle and the hornets could be used in non flocking situations later on to allow for more interactions in the game. I would like for this game to be themed like a forest or swap so adding a hive and hornets as an enemy is very fitting. Other than getting the scripts to work correctly this game was easier to create. 

for this project I used
I used the flocking zip for an example for a lot of the C# scripts 
I also used Copliot ai for organizing my code for some of the new scripts as well as debugging
I used the google ai thing for an example of how to update the area for the boids to kill the player
